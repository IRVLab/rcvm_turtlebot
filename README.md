# rcvm_turtlebot
rcvm_turtlebot provides an implementation for the RCVM for the Turtlebot2. You need rcvm_core to use this package, as rcvm_core provides the service definitions for the services implemented in this package.

To use, you can either call the launch file for a specific kineme anytime you want it, or you can start the server and call a service.

To use a launch file:

    roslaunch rcvm_turtlebot [kineme_name.launch]

To use the server manually:

    rosrun rcvm_turtlebot server.py
    rosservice call /rcvm/[kineme_name] [service-args]
